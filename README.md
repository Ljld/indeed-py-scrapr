Indeed.com clone with VueJS that uses a python Flask API

This is a work in progress. The end goal is to select keywords on a VueJS app to answer to job offers that match those keywords on Indeed.com.
The VueJS app will also be a clone of the website Indeed.com in order to learn how to scrape data.
I am using the Python framework Flask to build a "home-made" API to scrape data.
